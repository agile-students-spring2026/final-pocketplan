# Pocket Plan

## Product Vision Statement

**PocketPlan** helps college students plan their schedules more realistically by letting them estimate tasks, log actual time spent, and see how estimates compare to reality so they can recalibrate and avoid overcommitment.

## Description

PocketPlan is a mobile web application for college students who juggle coursework, jobs, extracurriculars, and social life. Users create tasks (assignments, exams, shifts, commitments), estimate how long each will take, and view daily and weekly schedules. After completing tasks, they log actual time spent and see simple comparisons between estimated and actual time. Gentle feedback helps them plan more realistically.

## Project History & Contributing

PocketPlan began as a response to a common problem among college students: underestimating how long tasks actually take. What began as a general productivity concept quickly evolved into a focused tool centered on improving time estimation. By enabling users to estimate tasks, log time spent, and compare the two, PocketPlan helps students recognize planning patterns and adjust accordingly. The project's direction is rooted in one goal: to help students build more realistic planning habits over time.
